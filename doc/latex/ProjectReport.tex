\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{T}{he} idea of the smart home has been around for a long time.
IoT devices enable the smart devices to be networked.
The use of these devices can provide users with several advantages,
such as increased comfort, increased safety, improved home management and maintenance,
energy savings, automation and convenience in general.

Furthermore, sensor networks augment the use of IoT devices by collecting data around the home.
Unlike centralized sensing, a network of sensors can provide a more granular understanding of the environment.
These sensors can be placed throughout the home, and connect using existing network infrastructure.

In this report we show the use of a sensor network that could be used for climate control.

\section{Project Description}

We are using an RP2040W as an IoT device, this will contain a web interface and it will
query nodes on the sensor network.
We did not have adequate time to implement this in hardware,
it is being mentioned for the purpose of explaining the concept.
Instead we have created a web interface that queries the sensor for the purpose of demonstration.
This can be seen in [Figure \ref{fig:npmweb}]

We're using an ESP01 devices as a nodes for the sensor network.
It will be paired with an AHT20 temperature and humidity sensor, 
which will be connected to the ESP01 over i2c.

The combination of the IoT device and the sensor network will create a smart system, specifically a smart thermostat.
In this implementation, 
the IoT device also serves as the smart system because it would have direct control of the air conditioner.

\subsection{Sensor}

An image of the sensor node can be seen in [Figure \ref{fig:sensor}].
The buttons are only for debugging purposes such as resetting the controller 
and putting it into programming mode to flash the firmware.
They are not used for any other function.

Setting up the device on the network is simple.
The device presents a WiFi access point that you can connect to using your phone or computer.
After you connect, a captive portal is presented where you can enter the necessary credentials 
such as the WiFi SSID and the password to connect the sensor to the network.
After this the device connects to the specified network,
and presents a server that returns a JSON that contains the readings for the onboard sensors.
If the network configuration is changed, or the device is unable to find or connect to the configured network,
the device presents an access point again and the user can repeat this process.

\section{Results}

The sensor responds with a JSON formatted string when sent an HTTP request to it's IP Address.

Here is an sample, a demonstration can be seen in [Figure \ref{fig:sensor_response}]:

% TODO REMOVE BEFORE SUBMISSION

\section{Internet of Things, Sensor Networks, and Smart Systems}

The IoT device in this use case serves two main responsibilities 
querying the sensors on the network, and providing a web interface.

The web interface should present a dashboard to the user where they can
monitor the temperature and set preferences.

In addition there should be physical buttons to raise and lower the temperature if needed.

\subsection{Smart System}

A smart system is the combination of a sensor network, internet connectivity, and control.

A smart thermostat would take measurements from the sensor network to make decisions.
Because of this control loop, this would be considered a smart system.

How should the system decide what to do? 
Using the average of the sensors, biased by the highest or lowest reading,
the thermostat would know how to maintain the temperature of the room.


Assume $S$ is a set of readings from the sensor network:

$S = \{sensor_1, sensor_2, sensor_3, ...sensor_n\}$

\bigskip

If the thermostat is set to maintain coolness,
then the the highest reading would be used as the bias:

\[
T_c = \frac{1}{n+1}\left[ \max_{s \in S} + \sum_{s \in S}{s} \right]
\]

\smallskip

If the thermostat is set to heat,
then the lowest temperature reading would be used as the bias:

\[
T_c = \frac{1}{n+1}\left[ \min_{s \in S} + \sum_{s \in S}{s} \right]
\]

Where $T_c$ is the computed temperature.

\bigskip


It is possible to create a smart system that automatically heats and cools as needed,
but this can result in a control loop that oscillates if not done correctly.
This is why thermostats generally do not have this functionality.
A control loop such as PID can manage a system like this,
however the engineering expense for such a system would far exceed the benefits 
outside of a controlled environment such as a laboratory.
A common change such as new furniture or home improvement
can require calibration of the PID parameters.

A simple solution for this can be the use of threshold values.
This assumes that the average daily temperature fluctuation is known.
If the temperature is within the specified range, nothing is done,

For example a target temperature of 75 is set, with a range of 68-78.
If the temperature rises above 78, the system cools to 75,
if the temperature drops below 68, the system heats to 75.

\[
T_c = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{s \in S}{s}
\]

$heat = T_c \le T_l$

$cool = T_c \ge T_u$

$off = T_l < T_c < T_u$

$action = argmax(heat, cool, off)$

\smallskip

Where $T_l$ is the lower bound, and $T_u$ is the upper bound.

\bigskip

As long as the average daily temperature fluctuation is within the bounds,
this system should not oscillate.

Furthermore such a system would be simple enough for an end user to configure themselves,
and the system can be extended to use external APIs to retrieve weather data 
and adjust this range automatically.

\section{Networking and Topology}

\subsection{Networking}

If a home has internet connectivity, it means that there is a existing network infrastructure.
Also the majority of ISP gateways already contain wireless networking capabilities.

As of 2021, 90\% percent of U.S households have a broadband internet subscription \cite{censusgov}.

Given this, it makes sense that the optimal way (in terms of cost and configuration) for sensor networks to communicate,
through this wireless network.

\subsection{Topology}

Given the selected networking method, the best topology for the sensor network is going to be a star network. 
This topology allows each node in the sensor network to notify a central IoT device (the RP2040W) of it's readings.
Alternatively the IoT device can scan for and query each sensor.
Also a house would have at most a few dozen sensors, so there is no risk of congestion on modern home networking hardware.
Even if there were 1000 sensors, this would not be a problem for modern hardware because the amount of data being transmitted is less than 1KB,
and each device is queried sequentially.

The size of an standard network packet is 1518 bytes, 
and the sensor returns approximately 114 bytes(chars) of data,
therefore the response data should fit into a single network transmission.

For the user it's simple and easy to set up, anyone that can connect a device to their WiFi can connect a sensor to the network.
The sensor presents a wifi AP, 
the user connects to it, 
it makes a setup portal appear on their device, 
and they simply enter their wifi credentials.

For sensors that may be out of range,
off the shelf WiFi repeaters may be used.

\section{Power}

\subsection{IoT Power}

Thermostats contain existing wiring for power, usually 24v AC.
For this project we are using a 24v AC to 12v DC converter, 
which will then be stepped down to 5v to power the IoT device.

Home HVAC systems are controlled using relays,
so the 12v rail can be used to trigger the relay.

This controller is programmed over the USB port,
so we are using that to power the device.

\subsection{Sensor network power}

According to the data sheet for the ESP8266, it should consume approximately 200mA under load.
According the data sheet for the AHT20, the sensor typically consumes about 3mA.
Both the sensor and controller will accept 3.3v.

Therefore a 3.3v power supply of 250mA (approximately 0.825W) should be sufficient.

For areas with sufficient lighting combination of solar and battery could be an option.
However it makes more sense to power the nodes using a USB adapter.

For the purpose of this project, 
we are simply powering it on the breadboard using the power from programmer.


\section{Security}

Because the devices connect to a WiFi network,
some of the security for the sensor network is already provided by 
the encryption mechanisms of the wireless network.
The IoT device however must be hardened against attacks because this is directly exposed to the internet.
In addition if the sensors are on a shared network, 
there should be security mechanisms to prevent spoofing the IoT device with false readings.
The sensor in our project is read-only and has no way being manipulated as far as we know.
This should be sufficient security for most users.


\subsection{Software Updates}

All though we did not implement over the air updates.
Updating the sensor network is possible using the ArduinoOTA.h library.

It is also possible to update the IoT device, however that can present security risks
because the IoT device is exposed to the internet.

One way to mitigate this is to run the update endpoint on a specific port,
block the port in the firewall,
and require the user to update the device from their local network.

Alternatively the update mechanism can be left exposed to the internet
and more sophisticated methods can be used such as code signing and requiring authentication,
so that the device will only accept firmware that has been signed with the appropriate keys,
and only after being properly authenticated.
Furthermore the update process would require end to end encryption to prevent MITM attacks.


\section{Conclusions and Further Research}


IoT has revolutionized the way we interact with our homes 
by allowing us to have intelligent living spaces.

The use of sensor networks in the home, like motion detectors, temperature sensors, 
and air quality sensors continuously collect and analyze data,
enhancing security, saving energy, and automating everyday tasks.

According to security.org \cite[Vigderman]{Vigderman}, 78\% of prospective home buyers are willing to pay more for smart home features, 
if you're wondering why people pick them.
Furthermore, according to 82\% of tenants, their residences should include at least one smart gadget\cite[Howell]{Howell}.

Based on data, you can presume that consumers recognize the value and appreciate convenience, security, 
and cost savings with cool features like voice-activated smart speakers, remotely controlled smart lighting, 
or multi functional smart appliances. 79\% of users say smart home gadgets have enhanced their life, 
increasing productivity by 44\%, security by 45\%, and overall happiness by 57\% \cite[Howarth]{Howarth}.

    \caption{Market Share By Type - \cite[Mariotti]{Mariotti}}
    \label{fig:sbd}
\end{figure}

The function of smart devices intended for security is to provide homeowners with peace of mind. 
The purpose of motion floodlights, motion sound alarms, smart doorbells, and smart cameras is to deter crime. 
According to the data in [Figure \ref{fig:sbd}], 26\% of all smart home devices fall under the Safety \& Security category. 

Devices for lighting and climate control are also included in the graph above. 
Climate control equipment includes space heaters, fans, humidifiers, and smart thermostats, among others.
Users can control the temperature of their homes thanks to all of these IoT-connected devices.

In order to prevent users from returning home to a dark house, 
it would be possible to remotely control the lighting and climate 
such that the power would be turned off while no one was home.
When the user returns, the sensors can update the IoT device to turn them back on.

The Energy and Water Control devices make up the graph's smallest category. 
This includes smart sprinkler systems, smart plugs, smart sensors, and smart appliances. 
Users might put a smart sensor beneath sinks in this application,
which would notify a smartphone in the event of a leak or when it senses moisture. 
When a user has small appliances that aren't automatically smart, smart plugs can be helpful. 
Users could remotely manage the appliance's power operations by using a smart plug. 
This is more efficient and conserves energy.

\subsection{Addtional Thoughts - Energy Savings}

The key to energy saving lies in better management of smart home devices. 
Optimizing our home's energy consumption systems will reduce our energy consumption. 
Smart devices and IoT Sensors in homes mean higher overall efficiency, through better remote control.

\subsection{Addtional Thoughts - Home Automation}

IoT automation connects physical objects to the internet, 
allowing for seamless data exchange and improved operational efficiency. 
This integration of IoT tech is transforming industries by enabling real-time data processing and communication between machines. 
Facilitating automation and remote monitoring, IoT drives the digital transformation of manufacturing and other industries, 
leading to smarter and more efficient operations. 

\subsection{Addtional Thoughts - Growth of IoT adoption in Homes}

IoT adoption and integration have increased over the past five years due to trends. 
According to Parks Associates \cite[Parks]{Parks}, the average US household owns on average 16 connected devices. 
Which is an increase from 2021 from 13 connected devices. 
Through home automation and security applications, energy management and energy efficiency services, 
new video distribution options through various connected devices, and remote control and monitoring capabilities, 
smart home, connected health, and connected entertainment products offer consumers a higher level of convenience.
